Setting-Up
==========

In this section, we'll go through how you can set-up your account pages to get started querying endpoints.

Billing
-------

The :code:`Billing` page is where you can set-up your payment information to recharge your account, and track your spending. 

By default, you can only top-up manually by clicking on :code:`Buy Credits`. **We recommend you set-up automatic refill** to avoid any disruption to your workflows when your credits run out.

Automatic refill
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Activating automatic refill requires you go through the dedicated :code:`Billing Portal` where you can add your preferred payment method, update your billing information, and download your invoices.

Clicking on :code:`Add Payment Methods` then lets you introduce your card information.

With your payment information set-up, you can now toggle automatic refill on and off as needed on the main billing page. 

Automatic refill lets you specify the cut-off amount at which your account is automatically refilled by the specified amount when it reaches it.

Pricing and credits
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Credits are consumed when you query endpoints. Because we **don't apply any charge on top of provider costs**, consumed credits directly reflect the cost of a request. Upon signing-up, you are automatically granted **$50 in free credits**!

.. note::
    You can check your current balance through the billing page but also also directly within your terminal by querying the `Get Credits Endpoint <https://unify.ai/docs/api/reference.html>`_ of the API.

Top-up codes
^^^^^^^^^^^^

You may have received a code to increase your number credits, if that's the case, you can activate it doing a request to this endpoint:

.. code-block:: bash

    curl -X 'POST' \
    'https://api.unify.ai/v0/promo?code=<CODE>' \
    -H 'accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_UNIFY_KEY>'

Simply replace :code:`<CODE>` with your top up code and :code:`<YOUR_UNIFY_KEY>` with your API Key and do the request ðŸš€

(Optional) Customizing your profile
-----------------------------------

Depending on the sign-up method you chose, some of the entries in the :code:`Profile` sections will already be populated. Regardless, you can use this page to change your email address, add your personal information, and sign out in case youâ€™d like to use another account.
