Welcome to Unify!
=================

Unify is your centralized platform for LLM endpoints. If you‚Äôre using or planning to use an LLM in your application or service, Unify lets you:

* **üîë Use any endpoint with one key**: You only need a Unify API Key to access the latest LLMs through any endpoint provider. Each model has a unfied API that enables seamless provider switching without needing to refactor.

* **üöÄ Route to the best endpoint**: Each prompt is assessed separately and sent to the endpoint that will (a) return the best response, and (b) yield the best performance for a target metric of your choice, including high-throughput, low cost or low latency.

* **‚öñÔ∏è Benchmark endpoint performance**: Our live, dynamic benchmarks let you objectively compare endpoints speed, latency and costs; to make informed decisions when selecting the model or provider that fits your needs.

Getting Started
---------------

To start querying our endpoints, generate a Unify API key by :code:`Signing Up` through the `console <https://console.unify.ai/>`_ . Grab your key through the dashboard, and let's see how you can `make your first request! <https://unify.ai/docs/hub/home/make_your_first_request.html>`_

For a deeper Walkthrough on how you can use the Unify console, check out the `walkthrough <https://unify.ai/docs/hub/home/walkthrough.html>`_ section.
